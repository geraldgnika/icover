This project was built on top of Adequate Framework v.1.0.0

iCover was accidentally deleted and no copy of it was made. But iCover's architecture exists and it is called Adequate.

iCover was accidentally deleted 3 times. The first two times it got deleted I chose to re make it from the beginning. When it got deleted the 3rd time I just dropped it.

iCover v.1.0.0 was just functional programming
iCover v.2.0.0 was OOP
iCover v.3.0.0 was built on top of my MVC framework (Adequate)
